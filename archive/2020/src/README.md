To use gulp, make sure to do an `npm install` in the parent directory first.

To build pages, run:

`gulp pages`

This will compile any files in the `/src/markdown` directory to an HTML file in the root directory.

To compile sass files, run: 

`gulp sass`

which will compile any files in `/src/style` to a CSS file in `/assets/css`.
