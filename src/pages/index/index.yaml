  <p>As an experienced full-stack developer, I am an expert at building and deploying web applications. I have expertise in many languages and frameworks, both tried-and-true and cutting-edge. As a maintainer of Argo, an open-source suite of Kubernetes-native application delivery software, I have contributed significant features to
